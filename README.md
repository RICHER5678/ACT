"
At ACT, we believe in giving 110%. By using our next-generation compassion network, we help women, girls, vulnerable women move out of the rotating door of rehab, relapse, return to addictive behaviours. We join with them in starting afresh in a sustainable manner, regardless of their background, level of education and socio-economic challenges.
